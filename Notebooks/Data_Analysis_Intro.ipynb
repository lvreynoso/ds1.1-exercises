    "\n",
    "    - Data analysis. Example: the telecom churn dataset is given, we want to obtain what is the percentage of loyal and non-loyal customers, which state has the highest churn customers, What is the maximum length of international calls among loyal users (Churn == 0) who do not have an international plan?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Data analysis and visualization. Normally comparison by plotting the result whichis easier for human than reading raw numbers\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Statistical analysis on the data. Example: the titanic dataset is given, at specific \"Embark\" what is the distibution of male passengers over all age (were they mainly young, middle age or old)"
